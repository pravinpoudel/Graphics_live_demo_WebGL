This is a repo where i push code implementing different ideas and tools to visualize 3D Volume Data.   

## Guidance :pray:
> ### This project is created with the help of [Prof. Dr. Steve Petruzza](https://stevepetruzza.io/) and [Will Usher](https://www.willusher.io/).

## Purpose
This is a repository where i push code to demonstrate different ideas in Scientific Visualisation.
***Currently, this repo is hosting the project code of volumetric raycasting.***
You can read the article explaning the idea and code in ***[icodeeveryday.com](https://www.icodeeveryday.com/sci-vis-volumetric-raycasting/)***. 

## Tools :rocket:
1. API- WebGL 2.O (OPENGL ES 3.O)
2. Shading Language - GLSL ES 3.O
3. Rendering Technique- Volumetric ray casting (Single-Pass)
4. Camera - Perspective Camera
5. Controller - ArcBall (using quaternions)
6. Bounding Box - Axis-Alligned Bounding Box (AABB)


## Note ( for someone  frustated with decoding in GLSL like i was) : 
JS file [webgl_lint.js](https://greggman.github.io/webgl-lint/webgl-lint.js) included in index.html is a library developed by  Gregg Tavares which is very useful tool for debugging specially for GLSL.
